### What is the demography?
Demography is the study of population, especially fertility (births), mortality (death), marriage & divorce and migration. It involves the scientific study of the size, distribution and composition of spaces and how these three components vary over time.

### Is the population data available to the small area?

### What is the definition of urban areas used by the Department?
The definition of urban is:

"Gazetted areas with their adjoining built-up areas, which had a combined population of 10,000 or more at the time of the Census 2010 or the special development area that can be identified, which at least had a population of 10,000 with at least 60 % of population (aged 15 years and above) were involved in non-agricultural activities."
